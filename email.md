Feel free to shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:wei.parker.guo.pb@gmail.com">wei.parker.guo.pb@gmail.com</a> if you want to get in touch! I check my mailbox once a day, and will try my best to get back to you within two working days.

Please go through this **checklist of cold emailing** so we can communicate better:

1. **Tailor your message to the recipient.** Demonstrate that you have put effort into understanding them. Additionally, make it clear why you are reaching out to them specifically and ensure that your request is not something easily fulfilled through other means.

2. **Establish credibility and trust.** Mention any mutual connections or relevant authority, credibility, or social status, or find uncommon commonalities to create a sense of belonging and uniqueness.

3. **Alleviate your audience’s pain or give them a common interest.** Why should the recipient care about your email? Why should they take time to respond to it? What’s in it for them?

4. **Make requests in a concise and clear manner.** Short and specific emails are more likely to be read and acted upon compared to lengthy, unclear ones.

If I didn't respond to a request, it means I didn't agree to do it.
