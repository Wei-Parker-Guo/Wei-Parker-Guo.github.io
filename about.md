I'm a computer science researcher focusing on multimedia computing. I'm currently interested in building data-driven, generative models involving <b>multiple modalities</b>, e.g. synthesizing audio signal from visual cues. I propel my research with one general problem: <b>what creates perception?</b>

I approach my problem from an inter-disciplinary perspective mixing <b>vision, graphics, natural language processing and neuroscience</b>. My ultimate goal is to generate <b>diverse and high-fidelity</b> multimedia contents that allow <b>intuitive editing</b> to fit production needs.

On this site, I post thoughts, notes and reports over various topics related to my works. You can read most of them in my <a href='/research'>research</a> and <a href='/blog'>blogs</a>.

In my spare time I enjoy: long-distance running, writing, traveling.
