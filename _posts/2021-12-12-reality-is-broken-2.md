In the [previous post]({% post_url 2021-12-05-reality-is-broken-1 %}) on _Reality Is Broken_[^1] we have discussed about the 4 features of work, and how game is closely related to work in its dynamics. I have derived a dynamical system to formalise the process of work/game and provided my rationales for doing so. I highly encourage interested reader to refer to that post to get familiar with what this book is about, as the introduction covers a brief summary of its content.

In this post we are gonna review the first 3 of the 7 traits of game that enhance reality, summarised by the author. These traits are mostly derived from psychological observations. The idea of this post is to provide a concise but ample explanation for each trait, so that it could be easily applied in game designs. In some of them I will also enclose more relevant theories, and several opinions of my own.

It should be noted that the theories in this post, no matter how well constructed and proven, usually stay within the perspectives of psychology/philosophy. Game, or play, is a fundamental feature of human being, but disciplines are not (J. Huizinga)[^2]. Therefore, these theories should serve as an errata-check rather than a cookbook for a game project: we refer to them in the hope of avoiding some mistakes, but never engineering the whole experience from them.

Let’s go through the first 3 traits now.

## Meeting positive challenges.
---

A player yearns for challenges during a game. The key trigger behind this behaviour is explained in positive psychology.

It turns out that the right amount of challenge, not too difficult nor too easy, keeps a person fully occupied by the task at hand. Enjoyment occurs from this immersion, and urges the participant to engage challenges continuously. This mental state of self-driven occupation is named the _flow state_ by Mihály Csíkszentmihályi[^3].

A flow state can only be maintained by full occupation, which requires three elements:

- **Objective** must be chosen by the player voluntarily.
- **Challenges** must be consistent.
- **Feedback** exists throughout the experience.

An autonomously picked objective gives player a sense of control. The player assumes responsibility for the task at hand, sometimes even deeming it as a crucial provider of purpose in life.

The consistent challenges keep a player busy. Always having something to do keeps a player from “drifting off” to other cognitive processes.

Finally, constant feedback reminds a player of his/her progress towards the objective. The feedback also gives explicit form to the joy attained from being in a flow. For example, the sound of engine becomes “music” to many racers in real life because it reminds them of the flow state racing offers.

The relationship among these three elements of flow could be illustrated as:

The author argues that a game beats many devices in achieving flow mainly because of its _automatic challenge adjustment_ feature, i.e. the rules of a game are dynamically adjusted by algorithms to give each player hand-crafted challenges. These challenges are just enough to keep their target busy, while not too discouraged to give up. In reality, such balance is difficult to maintain since the task assignment system is usually static and not individual-specific.

A game can push a player to his/her limits without breaking the good spirit, and always adjust the challenges in time to account for fluctuations. A person might be too sick to enjoy his office work some day, but can still find a good pace in a well-designed game. The experience of play, in other words, is mostly a _self-fulfilling prophecy_: we meet the just-right challenges we unknowingly set up for ourselves, always attaining satisfaction.

## From exotelic to autotelic.
---

> Autotelic, in greek as αὐτοτελής (autotelēs), formed from αὐτός (autos, "self") and τέλος (telos, "end" or "goal").[^4]

An exotelic participant places purpose and rewards on external events. An autotelic participant finds joy in internal flows instead, and has the ability to self-generate rewards.[^5] Exotelic happiness is limited by provision, while the autotelic one is endless: we could always reward ourselves by taking specific actions and attitudes.

In Buddhism, pariṇāmanā(transfer of merit/回向) is a fundamental lesson. It requires a practitioner to give the merit earned from good deeds to everyone else but himself. The idea is that we cannot procure happiness. Instead, happiness is found in abundance when we embark to do “good deeds” without any desires for results. The “without any desires” part coincides flawlessly with autotelos, and is deemed as the true path to happiness.

One of the common mistakes made by game designers is encouraging exotelic behaviours. A player joins a game for autotelic reasons: he/she needs the extra hard work because the experience itself is rewarding. Usually no one starts playing a game for winning a billion dollars.

However, by giving out poorly placed rewards, a designer “hijacks” the entertainment a player deserves. The participant, now with a handful of cheers, ranks and assets, becomes confused as to whether he/she is playing the game for fun or for the promise of these external rewards. Gradually, the player loses the power of ”having fun from play” and switches to “having fun from rewards after play”.  I call this effect “the hijacking of fun”.

<img src="/assets/img/2021-12-12/hijacking_of_fun.jpg" width="256" style="margin: auto;"/>

Perhaps one of the most difficult game elements to design, a ranking system is deeply troubled by this effect. Personally, I believe the reason behind this difficulty is that the sheer amount of external rewards from ranking cannot be well contained by a game designer.

Even though we can refrain from giving too many badges and coins, a ranked-up player could still gain ample external rewards from the player community. The mere notion of rank lies in comparison among peers. The intent for playing this game becomes superseding the other players rather than setting goals for oneself and conquering them. We can no longer generate rewards for ourselves in an autotelic manner: instead, we could only feel happiness by confirming our own superiority over others.

A game designer can hardly control this process, because the external rewards inherent in a ranking system are not manifested as explicit game elements, but implicit social elements. The player might only see a rank number, but it already promises one of the most powerful external rewards: you have been placed at the 14th; this means there are still 13 players who are better. It doesn’t matter what you have to do in the game, as long as you can beat every single one of them.

Whenever a game becomes exotelic for players, its essence is poisoned. A game that could only promise joy from badges earned, players beaten or coins earned is no longer a game: it becomes yet another reality simulator, making people suffer rather than entertained. This is the most despicable thing a game designer could do. It’s a murder of a player’s time and soul. He/she sits down tonight to regain the ability to enjoy life by oneself, but is relentlessly denied. Even worse, the player is tricked into sacrificing his/her time for even more torture from shallow desires and hopeless lies.

  We have been talking about the danger of encouraging exotelic behaviours for a while now. <b>But how do we keep players in the autotelic state and help them discover true happiness?</b>
  </div>
</div>

The answer is to offer plenty of opportunities for a player to perform autotelic behaviours in a game. If 8 out of 10 actions a player could choose lead to autotelic revelations, then the guidance is already made.

We cannot offer explicit instructions to anyone about autotelos, just as we cannot teach happiness to a person. Nevertheless, we could make one’s path to endless joy a little bit easier to find. Thus, the question now changes from how to what: what autotelic systems can we put in a game?

There are six such systems observed by the author, and here they are, explained:

---

> Voluntarily find and face hard challenges.

In other words, constantly breaking the comfort zone could yield endless rewards. When we are bored we pretend the trash bin to be a basketball basket. We pretend floor as lava and sofa as islands. We pose challenges for ourselves and can naturally claim rewards from them.

> Finish a task that’s extremely difficult for oneself.

This is different from finding new challenges. We are aiming to push our limits on an old challenge here instead. We get a sense of achievement whenever we succeed in doing so. If I can’t dance, then I will be thrilled if I can complete a short waltz someday.

> Make others laugh.

We will laugh if we can make others laugh. Social animals reflect happiness back like mirrors. This is manifested extremely well in _Human Fall Flat_, where a player can feel entertained if his/her teammates are amused by the awkward movements he/she performs.

> Sync with others.

We feel a harmony and joy when we synchronise flawlessly with others. Imagine if you are a pilot, how cool would it be if you can follow the team, diving and bombing almost as if one person is flying? An [excerpt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6Nwl4blt-0&ab_channel=AFGuidesHD) from _Battlefield V_ illustrates this concept perfectly.

> Look for a moving story.

Reporters always have this revelation. Chasing after deep stories is not just to understand what happened, but to reflect on ourselves. If we can’t find stories from others, we can always generate our own stories, which is officially termed memory. Therefore, memory is not passively received, but actively created. If one masters the art of story and memory, then he/she can always find happiness by crafting it.

> Trigger curiosity.

Curiosity could be triggered by oneself from the most mundane setups. A ritual is a manifesto of such a behaviour. For example, we could make any day interesting by giving it a “ritual name”. By calling some common day an “anniversary”, we are suddenly very curious about what might go on during it. Similarly, when we buy [blind boxes(ガシャポン)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gashapon#Blind-boxes), satisfying curiosity is the biggest motive.

---

The list is far from complete. Autotelic systems are presented in so many ways, that their number might be as large as the number of life forms on this planet. In fact, I think life is perhaps one of the most basic autotelic phenomena: it generates and fulfils its own purpose. Game, therefore, is essentially an experience of life.

Nevertheless, we could think along certain directions of human needs and see if we can discover autotelic systems in them. The key is to observe how people can satisfy these needs without resorting to any external factors. Here are some such directions for the curious readers:
- We all want to have meaningful jobs.
- We all want to experience success.
- We all want to build social connections (yes, even for introverts).
- We all want to surpass personal significance and work for something bigger than our own careers.

Another thing we can do is to promise rewards instead of offering them straightaway. This will get external hijacking out of the way. One thing to note here is that the promise should be simple and straightforward enough to take effect. If someone rings a bell, the simplest promise is hearing a ring. Indirect promises, such as being served dinner, are not powerful enough for guidance.

## Towards blissful productivity.
---

> Blissful Productivity: The idea that playing in a game makes you happier working hard, than you would be relaxing. Essentially, we’re optimised as human beings by working hard, and doing meaningful and rewarding work.[^6]

Yes, game is work. Unlike many other jobs, its product is happiness. The blissful productivity we obtain from game depends on many factors. The formula is here:

$$\begin{gathered}P=\sum_{d} \frac{E_{d}}{T_{d}H\left( X_{d}\right)  } ,\  \text{s.t.} \  H\left( X\right)  \text{is entropy.} \\ \\ P\leftarrow \text{blissful productivity} ,\\ d\leftarrow \text{task dimension} ,\\ E_{i}\leftarrow \text{player engagement in task i} ,\\ X_{i}\leftarrow \text{outcomes of task i} ,\\ T_{i}\leftarrow \text{required time to complete task i} .\end{gathered}$$

We can consider a game as consisted of several tasks, each constituting a separate dimension. It can be observed here that blissful productivity is affected by each variable in different manners:

- **Task Dimensions: **a higher variety of tasks gives a player higher sense of blissful producitivity. In short, we always need to keep a player busy by offering enough jobs.
- **Engagement: **unlike movies or music, game doesn’t have passive audience. If a player is fed the outcomes of events by a game, he won’t feel productive at all. A player needs to stay engaged as long as possible in game events.
- **Task Outcomes: **a task’s outcome must be clear, i.e. after the player has completed the events, there must be a definitive result. We use an information entropy to represent this determination. A lower entropy of outcomes ensures that a player can have a sense of productivity, of actually accomplishing/changing something.
- **Task Implementation: **a task must be straightforward to implement a solution. Many real-life work actually has good dimensionality, engagement and outcomes, but takes a long time to complete. If the solution is impossible to implement in short time, we will lose many players before they have a chance to taste the sweetness of productivity.

I think the formula provided can be very handy in measuring blissful productivity without personal bias. All the terms have existent metrics in reality, e.g. engagement could be measured by APM and outcome by probability distributions. We then have a fair metric to compare blissful productivity offered by different game designs, and could also use the result to optimise our own projects.

  Now that we know what factors contribute to blissful productivity, <b>how can we implement them better in practise?</b>
  </div>
</div>

### How to set up clear outcomes.
As we have already established, a clear set of outcomes must have low entropy whenever a player is done with a task. This means we can’t leave the player to “guess” his outcomes when a task is finished. Instead, we must emphasise the consequences. This is best manifested in the “+1” mechanism of many games, where a player will receive realtime feedback once he succeeds in a task: +1 intelligence, +1 experience, +1 health and so on.

But the outcomes are not only limited to personal features. Just as in real life, a player’s task could have impact on the community. A clan of players, for example, has similar features to an individual: it can have experience (in doing certain tasks), health (size of the clan) and levels (average level of the members). Completion of a game task could lead to community outcomes as well, and we need to constantly remind a player of these consequences.

Finally, we could even design the game to make a player feel his task’s importance to the entire world. In _Death Stranding_, the equipments successfully set up by a player would be available to the entire game world. A player could build a bridge, for instance, and help all other players to travel with ease. This grants world-level impact to a player’s task. This is easily the final goal of many great human beings. We can help our players achieve it, as long as we make this outcome clear for them.

### How to raise engagement and accelerate implementation through constraints.
Engagement results from a player’s necessary actions during a task event. Watching out for incoming enemies in a war game is not engaging: there are no actions. The player just sit there and watch the screen. However, if we add the necessity to perform certain actions to complete the “overwatch”, then engagement is created. In _Call of Duty: Warzone_, a heartbeat detector needs to be constantly manoeuvred to scan enemies nearby, and a controllable UAV is also provided for this purpose. These actions of necessity could be referred to as “constraints”. They are the rules of completing a certain task. They eliminate passive participations.

Implementation can also be accelerated by setting up these constraints. At a first glance this might be confusing: how could limiting one’s actions help with task completion? Well, congrats on finding yet another dilemma of human beings. We hate constraints, but they are actually the source of creativity and efficiency. They provide a very essential function: the elimination of redundant choices.

![](/assets/img/2021-12-12/thai_dinner.jpg)

Let’s imagine that we are going out for dinner tonight. How do we decide what to eat quickly? Here is something that definitely won’t help: offering you a wikipedia list of all the cuisines in this world. If we can limit our choices first, say to Thai food, then we can narrow down to action much quicker! This is essentially how constraints work. They try to present choices to us as clear-cut as possible, so we can actually decide and do something.

It’s crucial for a game designer to be aware of all the constraints in his game. By maintaining a list of constraints, he can quickly adjust the engagement and implementation of a player. Better yet, this could all be done through algorithms using the formula derived, or some more project-specific metrics, so that the game could be dynamically adjusted to offer blissful productivity to any player.

### How to increase task dimensions.
Task dimensions represent the diversity of tasks that a game can offer. The key definition here is that these dimensions are independent from each other: each task can be separated from the rest and completed on its own.

A good template to devise separate tasks is by studying real-life job classification. These classes are proven by trials to be independent of each other, since different individuals can be trained and hired separately for each class. According to the author of _Reality Is Broken_, we have at least the following categories:
- High Risk Tasks
- Repetitive Tasks
- Physical Tasks
- Intellectual Tasks
- Explorative Tasks
- Community Tasks
- Creative Tasks

The discussion of how to design these tasks needs too much space because we are adventuring in the root of human productivity here. Therefore, I will try to discuss them in other posts. For now, I think it would be beneficial to list their names so some “constraints” (aha!) could be laid for actual task designs.

Blissful productivity has many other mechanisms which could be considered in game designs. This section serves as an introduction to the general concept and popular applications.

## Recap
