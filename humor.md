## Sources

I collect humor from various sources and write some myself. It's hard to attribute many jokes to specific authors since they have been widely referenced, so thank you everyone!

"Nothing is random, only uncertain", said Gail Gasram in context of Diehard tests for random number generation. He might uncertainly, but definitely not randomly, be the author Marsaglia G.

**The Term Dictionary, Adapted from Michael Stueben (November 7, 1994)**


Today it is considered an egregious faux pas to speak or write in the crude antedated terms of our grandfathers.  To assist the isolated student and the less sophisticated teacher, I have prepared the following list of currently fashionable mathematical terms in academia. I pass this list on to the general public as a matter of charity and in the hope that it will lead to more refined elucidation from young scholars.

**A Pseudo Random Translation of Night's Watch's Oath from Game of Thrones**

| original                                         | translation                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Night gathers, and now my watch begins.          | I need a seed to initialize my state.                                                         |
| It shall not end until my death.                 | I shall exhaust every possible integer value with my random bits.                             |
| I shall take no wife,                            | My independent generators should not share states,                                                 |
| hold no lands,                                   | the states should be modified in-place,                                                       |
| father no children.                              | the states should not be correlated with their successors.                                    |
| I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.         | I should produce identical random results compared to other generators.                            |
| I shall live and die at my post.                 | After the full period is reached, I should not continue generation.                           |
| I am the sword in the darkness.                  | I deterministically draw samples out of a uniform distribution, and all Monte Carlos need me. | 
| I am the watcher on the walls.                   | I'm heavily involved in encryptions.                                                          |
| I am the shield that guards the realms of men.   | Again, I'm very important in encryptions.                                                     |
| I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, | I can be combined again with other generators,                                                     |
| for this night and all the nights to come.       | and together we will still produce good randomness, perhaps with longer periods.              |

Man, I think Georgeo R. R. Martin really loves pseudo random number generators.

But then again, if I'm reborn as a computer program, this settles which kind of algorithms I would least prefer to be implemented as.

Several scientists were all posed the following question: "What is 2 * 2 ?"

The engineer whips out his slide rule (so it's old) and shuffles it back and forth, and finally announces "3.99".

The physicist consults his technical references, sets up the problem on his computer, and announces "it lies between 3.98 and 4.02".

The mathematician cogitates for a while, then announces: "I don't know what the answer is, but I can tell you, an answer exists!".

Philosopher smiles: "But what do you mean by 2 * 2 ?"

Logician replies: "Please define 2 * 2 more precisely." 

The sociologist: "I don't know, but it was nice talking about it".

Behavioral Ecologist: "A polygamous mating system".

Medical Student : "4" All others looking astonished : "How did you know ??"

Medical Student : "I memorized it."

Dean, to the physics department:

"Why do I always have to give you guys so much money, for laboratories and expensive equipment and stuff?

Why couldn't you be like the math. department - all they need is money for pencils, paper and waste-paper baskets.

Or even better, like the philosophy department. All they need are pencils and paper."

A mathematician decides he wants to learn more about practical problems. He sees a seminar with a nice title: "The Theory of Gears." So he goes. The speaker stands up and begins, "The theory of gears with a real number of teeth is well known ..."

**Evolution of Math Teaching:**

1. 1960s: A peasant sells a bag of potatoes for $10. His costs amount to 4/5 of his selling price. What is his profit?

2. 1970s: A farmer sells a bag of potatoes for $10. His costs amount to 4/5 of his selling price, that is, $8. What is his profit?

3. 1970s (new math): A farmer exchanges a set P of potatoes with set M of money. The cardinality of the set M is equal to 10, and each element of M is worth $1. Draw ten big dots representing the elements of M. The set C of production costs is composed of two big dots less than the set M. Represent C as a subset of M and give the answer to the question: What is the cardinality of the set of profits?

4. 1980s: A farmer sells a bag of potatoes for $10. His production costs are $8, and his profit is $2. Underline the word "potatoes" and discuss with your classmates.

5. 1990s: A farmer sells a bag of potatoes for $10. His or her production costs are 0.80 of his or her revenue. On your calculator, graph revenue vs. costs. Run the POTATO program to determine the profit. Discuss the result with students in your group. Write a brief essay that analyzes this example in the real world of economics.
